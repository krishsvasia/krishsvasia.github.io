### About Me
I am an Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham with strong academic performance and I am currently building my experience in development through my own personal projects. I am experienced in collaborative environments and am adaptable through customer-facing roles, improving my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. I am looking forward to learning more about AI and Software Engineering, and aim to become a part of impactful projects related to these in the future.
