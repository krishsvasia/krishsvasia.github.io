## Introduction
I am starting this devlog to document my personal projects and technical learning outside of university. 

This series serves as a mechanism for **weekly accountability**. Every week, I will update this page with what I have built, the concepts I have learned, and the roadblocks I have faced. 

## Recent Milestone: Options 101
I recently completed the **Akuna Capital Options 101** course. While my background is in CS and AI, I have always been intrigued by the mechanics of trading and market microstructure.

The course bridged the gap between theory and practice, clarifying the specific roles of market participants (like Market Makers) and solidifying my understanding of core derivatives concepts, particularly **Call/Put Parity** and **The Greeks** (Delta/Gamma).

## Current Focus: Modern C++
My primary technical focus is mastering **C++26**.

I am taking a "first principles" approach, working through `LearnCPP` to ensure I build a rigorous understanding of the language's memory model rather than just syntax. 

To consolidate this theory, I have set a hard deadline: I aim to have a fully implemented **Zero-Copy Parser** by the end of February (Devlog 4).

## Current Project: Zero-Copy Market Data Parser
